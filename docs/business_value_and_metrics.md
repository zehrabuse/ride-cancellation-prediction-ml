## Business Value

If the proposed decision support system performs effectively, it can enable companies to make operational decisions more quickly and efficiently. 
By identifying high-risk cancellation scenarios in advance, the platform can improve customer satisfaction, reduce operational losses, and increase overall profit margins.

A portion of the increased profitability can be reinvested in strategies aimed at further enhancing customer satisfaction, allowing the company to differentiate itself from competitors and strengthen its position in the market.

## Model Success Metrics

Recall is defined as the primary success metric of this project because it directly reflects the model’s ability to identify rides that are likely to be canceled. 
From a business perspective, failing to detect an actual cancellation represents the most critical risk, as it may lead to revenue loss, decreased customer satisfaction, and inaccurate evaluation of operational performance. 

In contrast, incorrectly predicting a non-canceling ride as high risk may introduce additional precautionary actions and minor operational costs, but it does not pose the same level of business impact. 
Therefore, prioritizing recall ensures that high-risk cancellation cases are captured effectively, enabling proactive decision-making, better operational control, and the preservation of overall business value.
