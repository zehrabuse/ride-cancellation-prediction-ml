### Business Problem Definition

Increasing ride cancellation rates in ride-hailing platforms create significant operational and financial challenges. Cancellations result in direct revenue loss for the company, while drivers may waste time and fuel traveling to pickup locations without completing a ride. Additionally, frequent cancellations negatively impact customer satisfaction and reduce customer loyalty.

As a consequence, these factors contribute to lower profit margins and weaken the platform’s competitive position in the market.

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a ride cancellation prediction system that supports data-driven decision-making for ride-hailing platforms. By estimating the likelihood of ride cancellations in advance, the system aims to function as a decision support tool for both the company and end users.

From a business perspective, the platform can identify high-risk scenarios and take preventive actions such as adjusting pricing strategies or offering incentives to reduce cancellations and retain customers. From the user perspective, the system increases transparency and helps users avoid potential time loss, ultimately contributing to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Data-Driven Decision Support

The ride cancellation prediction results can support several operational and strategic decisions within ride-hailing platforms. These include:

- Estimating the optimal number of active drivers and vehicles required during specific time periods.
- Identifying high-risk cancellation intervals and locations that require operational improvements.
- Supporting driver performance evaluation and decisions related to driver retention.
- Guiding targeted interventions in high cancellation scenarios to improve service quality.

 ### Expected Business Impact

The decision support system developed within this project is expected to reduce revenue loss and help retain customers who are at risk of cancellation. By predicting ride cancellations in advance, the platform can take timely and effective actions that contribute to improved customer satisfaction.

The generated business value can be reinvested in strategies aimed at enhancing the overall customer experience, which in turn supports an increase in profitability. Rather than focusing solely on fixing isolated issues, this approach enables the continuous improvement of already well-performing systems, allowing the company to strengthen its market position and gain a competitive advantage over rival platforms.
