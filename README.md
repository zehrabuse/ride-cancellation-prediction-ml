# Ride Cancellation Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the probability of ride cancellations using
machine learning techniques. The project follows an end-to-end machine learning
pipeline, starting from business problem definition to model deployment and
result visualization.

## Business Problem
Ride cancellations negatively affect customer satisfaction and operational
efficiency. By predicting cancellation probability in advance, companies can
take proactive actions to reduce cancellations and improve service quality.

## Business Objectives

Detailed documentation of the business objectives, decision support perspective, and expected business impact of this project is available below:

- 📊 [Business Value & Success Metrics](docs/business_value_and_metrics.md)


## Machine Learning Pipeline
The machine learning workflow is designed as a linear pipeline aligned with the
weekly project plan. The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. Problem Definition & Business Understanding  
2. Data Loading  
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Feature Engineering  
6. Model Training  
7. Model Evaluation  
8. Prediction  
9. Insight Generation  
10. Deployment and Demo Interface  

The complete workflow is illustrated using an activity diagram.

## Activity Diagram
The activity diagram illustrates the complete end-to-end machine learning
pipeline, starting from business problem definition to model deployment and
result visualization. The workflow is aligned with the weekly project plan and
does not include decision nodes, as the process follows a linear pipeline
structure.

The activity diagram is provided both as a visual image and as an editable
draw.io source file in the `diagrams/` folder. A detailed textual explanation
of the activity diagram is available in the file
`ml_pipeline_activity_description.txt`.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the ML pipeline  
- `models/` – Trained machine learning models  
- `deployment/` – Demo application for model deployment  
- `diagrams/` – UML activity diagram (PNG and draw.io source)  
- `docs/` – Project management documentation (team members, timeline, budget)  
- `ml_pipeline_activity_description.txt` – Textual explanation of the ML pipeline  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Streamlit or Flask  

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the notebooks in order from the notebooks/ folder to reproduce the
machine learning pipeline.


## Deployment Status
The demo application will be added in the deployment stage. This repository
currently focuses on data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Documentation
Project planning details such as team members, project overview, timeline, and
budget are documented in the Excel file located in the `docs/` folder.
