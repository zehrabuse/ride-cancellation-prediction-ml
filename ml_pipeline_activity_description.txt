ML PIPELINE ACTIVITY DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION

The activity diagram illustrates the complete end-to-end machine learning
pipeline, starting from business problem definition to model deployment and
result visualization. The workflow is aligned with the weekly project plan
and does not include decision nodes, as the process follows a linear pipeline
structure.

This text file describes the complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline
implemented in this project.

1. Problem Definition & Business Understanding
In the first stage, the business problem is clearly defined by identifying the
ride cancellation issue and its impact on business operations. Stakeholders are
identified, success metrics are defined, and the overall structure of the
dataset is examined to understand the available features.

2. Load Historical Ride Dataset
The historical ride dataset is loaded into the system. This dataset contains
information related to ride requests, user behavior, and ride outcomes, which
will be used for further analysis and model training.

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
In this step, the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values
are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are
scaled to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand data distributions,
identify patterns, and analyze ride cancellation behavior. Visualizations are
used to explore correlations and trends within the data.

5. Feature Engineering
New features are created to improve model performance. Feature selection is
applied to identify the most relevant variables. The dataset is then split into
training and testing sets.

6. Train Machine Learning Model
Machine learning models are trained using the prepared dataset. A baseline
model is implemented first, followed by more advanced models. Hyperparameter
tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

7. Evaluate Model Performance
The trained models are evaluated using standard performance metrics including
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis. The best
performing model is selected based on these evaluation results.

8. Predict Ride Cancellation Probability
The selected model is used to predict the probability of ride cancellation for
new or unseen data.

9. Generate Insights & Visual Outputs
Model results are interpreted to generate business insights. Feature importance
analysis and visual outputs are created to support decision-making and explain
model behavior.

10. Display Results in Demo Interface
The final model is prepared for deployment and integrated into a demo interface
where predictions and visual outputs can be displayed to the user.

End of pipeline.
